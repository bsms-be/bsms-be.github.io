It is with deep sadness that we learned of the passing of emeritus professor Etienne Waelkens at the age of 72. Etienne will be dearly missed by his family, friends, and colleagues. He was a valued member of our Society, attending every meeting from 2008 to 2021 without fail. As co-organizer of the 2017 BSMS meeting in Leuven, his contribution made this a successful and unforgettable symposium. As a medical doctor and researcher, Etienne dedicated his professional life to the study of protein phosphorylation, proteomics and imaging mass spectrometry exploring the therapeutic potential of kinases and phosphatases. His contributions to science were both significant and inspiring.
Etienne will be remembered by all who knew him as a friendly, optimistic, and always smiling presence - a colleague who brought warmth and positivity to every interaction.
